## A. DEFINING THE PROJECT
#### Project Summary:
In the era of technology, the recommendation system has made finding the things easy that we need. Movie recommendation system's aim is to helping movie enthusiasts by suggesting what movie to watch without having to go through the long process of choosing from a large set of movies which go up to thousands and millions that is time consuming and confusing. Our aim is to reduce the human effort by suggesting movies based on the user’s interests. Additionally, nowadays the modern technologies like machine learning and deep learning plays a vital role in the process flexible technologies for day to day operations. In this project, we developed movie recommendation system by using machine learning.  This system is based on a collaborative approach, computes the connection between different clients and relying upon their ratings, prescribes movies to others who have similar tastes, subsequently allowing users to explore more. It is a web application that allows users to rate movies as well as recommends them appropriate movies based on other's ratings.
